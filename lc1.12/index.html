    <h1 title="this one is even better">Lamarus Amalgamate (1.12.2)</h1>

    <p class="paragraph" title="smaller text wall than the other one">Lamarus Amalgamate is basically a direct upgrade from my first modpack. More mods, a much newer version of minecraft, and better progression. <br> <br> Almost all of the mods from Composite have been carried over (and many new ones have been added) with some notable exceptions. Around 3 had no 1.12.2 version so they had to be left out and ProjectE/Draconic Evolution were removed to make the packs progression better. <br> <br> If you have any suggestions for mods to add or for changes to the config, feel free to hop into the discord server. </p>
