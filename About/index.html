      I am Adrian "Agent__Maxwell" Von Braunbehrens, and I hate using text to express myself.
       In leiu of a real conversation with me, this section of my website should give you a good idea of my interests, hobbies, and beliefs.<br>
      
      It has practically always been my plan to become a game designer of some sort, and I am still very interested in the field. 
       However I also want to do a billion other things because I have learned 0 lessons about scope creep. 
       I am an aspiring (in no particular order) artist, coder, game designer, government official, writer, musician, mad scientist, youtuber, and 3D artist.
       Most of those are just hobbies for me right now, and a few are pipe dreams.<br>
      
      My interests include music, reading, video games, and most of the other things human beings like.
       I won't be listing everything here for obvious reasons, if you're curious about specifics there are links everywhere.<br>

      My politics are not fully described by any of the various terms.
       I've read The Communist Manifesto and resonate with it. I agree with many Anarchists that I have listened to.
       I really just want people to be happy and have fulfilling lives. Oh and I'm vegan btw.<br>
