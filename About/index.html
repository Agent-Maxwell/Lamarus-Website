      Hello!!! My name is Adrian (or Vivian, whichever you prefer) Von Braunbehrens.
       I have gone by Agent__Maxwell and Draino in the past, so if you know either of those then you know me !
       My pronouns are She/Her.
       In leiu of a real conversation with me, this section of my website should give you an idea of what I'm like.<br><br>
      
      I was at the University of Utah studying computer science with an emphasis in game design for around two years.
      I dropped out for various reasons that I love to complain about and took a few years off of college.
      Currently (as of February 2026) I am enrolled in Salt Lake Community College studying political science.<br><br>
      
      My interests include music, reading, video games, and most of the other things human beings like.
       For more exhaustive lists of all of these, check the links below and probably some of the other sections of this site.<br><br>

      My politics are not fully described by any of the various terms, and I find that using any of them just puts me in a box in someones head.
      That being said I will call myself a communist most of the time.
       If you want more nuance on my beleifs, check the "Political Musings" section.
       Oh and I'm vegan btw.<br>
