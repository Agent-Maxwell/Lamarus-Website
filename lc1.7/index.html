    <h1 title="actually kinda proud of this">Lamarus Composite (1.7.10)</h1>

    <p title="text wall moment" class="paragraph">I've always loved modded Minecraft, and regularly edited preexisting packs by adding new mods or editing configs. After years of just sharing my modpacks with my friends through google drive, I decided to actually create and host an official version of my pack. <br> <br> I chose ATLauncher to host the pack simply because it's the best pack hosting service I've found. I made by far the most changes I ever have to any pack on Lamarus Composite and I think the end result is quite fun (although EMC is hell to balance). <br> <br> If you have any suggestions for mods to add, configs to change, or just want to tell me that I suck, contact me on discord at Agent__Maxwell#7418.</p>
